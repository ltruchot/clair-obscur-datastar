# Disruption

<ul>
    <li>Is everyone really focus during tech sessions ? Do you still like it?
    <br />New ideas are always welcome!
    </li>
</ul>
<br  />
<ul>
    <li>What about splitting up in small groups workshops sometimes (i.e. event storming with Fabien) ?<br />

    <br />
        It would imply:
     <ul>
        <li>Register to session ahead of time</li>
        <li>Find even more topic you want to discuss</li>
        <li>Be even more focused</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
