# Architecture Decision Record ADR-001: Monorepo For and Hexagonal Architecture With Domain-Driven Design - TypeScript Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-09-24

## Context
We need to establish a robust foundation for our MVP that addresses the following requirements:
- Track technical decisions and trade-offs systematically
- Enable rapid addition of new projects to the workspace
- Ensure high maintainability and scalability over time
- Standardize code quality through shared linting and formatting rules
- Unify testing configuration across all projects
- Centralize build and task runner configuration
- Use TypeScript as the primary development language
- Provide clear directives for AI-assisted development (Claude Code)
- Implement proper version control practices

## Decision
We will implement a monorepo architecture using the following technology stack and practices:

### Architecture & Design
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** with Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- ✅ **ADR documentation** system (starting with this 001.md as both template and first record)

### Technology Stack
- ✅ **Monorepo management**: PNPM workspace with shared, centralized dependencies
- ✅ **Core technologies**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vite, Vitest, Git
- ✅ **Backend framework**: Hono with Datastar for SSE-based real-time updates
- ✅ **Frontend approach**: Hypermedia-first with server-side state management

### Implementation Milestones
- ✅ Created shared TypeScript utilities library
- ✅ Established "Hello World" project with Hono + Datastar SSE integration
- ✅ Configured testing infrastructure for all workspace projects
- ✅ Set up cross-project imports (utilities library accessible from Hono project)
- ✅ Documented project standards (CLAUDE.md, ADRs, README.md) for both human and AI developers

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistency**: All projects share the same tooling, reducing cognitive overhead
- **Maintainability**: Centralized dependency management simplifies updates
- **Developer Experience**: Standardized workflows across all projects
- **Code Quality**: Enforced linting and formatting rules maintain high standards
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Shared utilities reduce code duplication
- **AI Collaboration**: Clear documentation enables effective AI-assisted development
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new applications and packages to the workspace

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand monorepo concepts and PNPM workspaces
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: More configuration required upfront compared to single projects
- **Build Time**: May increase as the monorepo grows (mitigated by proper caching)
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Shared dependencies may create version constraints across projects

## Alternatives Considered
- **Polyrepo approach**: Rejected due to increased maintenance overhead and code duplication
- **Nx monorepo**: Considered but deemed overly complex for current needs
- **Lerna**: Evaluated but PNPM workspaces provide sufficient functionality with less complexity
- **Rush**: Powerful but too enterprise-focused for our requirements

## Future Decisions and Recommendations
The following areas should be addressed in subsequent ADRs:

### Near-term Decisions
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Define continuous integration and deployment strategy (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar)
- **API Documentation Standards** - Establish OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for Hono endpoints

### Medium-term Considerations
- **Build Optimization** - Evaluate Turborepo or Nx cache integration if build times become problematic
- **Monitoring and Observability** - Define logging, metrics, and tracing standards
- **Security Practices** - Establish dependency scanning, secret management, and security headers policies
